# Space Tyckiting
This fork adds a relatively simple Javascript bot called *MajorTom* to the [Space Tyckiting repository](https://github.com/futurice/space-tyckiting).
It's not the best bot available for the game (see below), but it might help you to get started with the game since it comes with source code comments and it's written in Javascript and is therefore easy to use.

Comparison of available bots
---------------------------------------
There are currently (as of 23 March 2016) three bots available in the various forks of the Space Tyckiting repository: [*Paradroid*](https://github.com/keskival/space-tyckiting) by [keskival](https://github.com/keskival), [*mee_roskiin*](https://github.com/fennekki/space-tyckiting) by [fennekki](https://github.com/fennekki) and *MajorTom*, the bot in this repository.
Here is how they perform against each other:
Bot 1 | wins | Bot 2
--- | --- | ---
*mee_roskiin* | 5:5 | *Paradroid*
*mee_roskiin* | 8:2 | *MajorTom*
*Paradroid* | 5:5 | *MajorTom*

Each AI played against each other AI 10 times. The table above shows which bot won how many of the 10 games. I.e. *mee_roskiin* won 8 of the 10 games against *MajorTom*. There were no ties. The default game rules were used (no asteroids, 3 ships per team, etc.), with one exception: the time per round was raised to 10 seconds to avoid timeouts.
